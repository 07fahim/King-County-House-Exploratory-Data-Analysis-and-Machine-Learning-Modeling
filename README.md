🏡 King County House Price Prediction

📌 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict house prices in King County, USA, using machine learning models. By leveraging various data processing techniques and predictive modeling, we explore the key factors influencing house prices and build models to estimate them accurately.

📊 Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the King County Housing Dataset, which includes features such as:

📍 Location details

🏠 Number of bedrooms and bathrooms

📏 Square footage of living area and lot

📅 Year built and renovations

🌊 Waterfront view, condition, and grade

🔍 Key Insights
Living area, grade, and condition are the most significant predictors of house prices.

House prices are right-skewed, requiring log transformation for better model performance.

Ensemble models (Gradient Boosting & XGBoost) performed best in predictive accuracy.
